Martensite 
Martensite, named after the German metallurgist Adolf Martens (1850â€“1914), most commonly refers to a very hard form of steel crystalline structure, but it can also refer to any crystal structure that is formed by diffusionless transformation. It includes a class of hard minerals occurring as lath- or plate-shaped crystal grains.
